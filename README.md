# Workshop: Workflows for big data

- Angela McGaughran (Australian National University)

This workshop will take participants through common workflows for big data. We will start with experimental design and move through genomic library preparation to common bioinformatic problems. We will finish with a worked example of population genomics in action, where we use code in R to understand the effects of translocation and founder events on the genetic diversity of Australian populations. For those who want to follow along with the demonstration, the package [PopGenome](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PopGenome/index.html) will need to be installed in R.
